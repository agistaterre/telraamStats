## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed unnecessary dontrun wrappers, except for the API calls that
  require an API key.

* Modified the write functions so that they do not write to the user's 
  directory by default.
  
* Update License file (License: CC BY-SA 4.0)
  
## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
